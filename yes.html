                <h1 class = "header">HAPPY VALENTINES DAY JULIANA!</h1>
                <p class="Message"> Hello Yana!!! It's my first time greeting you happy valentines, I'm still a little shy to send this 
                    but I hope you appreciate this little surprise that I have ^_^ !!! Thank you for giving me the 
                    opportunity to wait for you! Even though I miss you even more as days go by, I promise to 
                    wait for you and endure this pangungulila chariz. To be honest, from the moment I met you, 
                    I wasn't planning to have another relationship or any type of romantic things again. But! 
                    I don't know how it came to the point wherein talking to you makes me smile and whenever I 
                    see you, my heart beats faster than it definitely should have... It all started from that 
                    Aishte Imasu conversation and I'm grateful that that conversation happened HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA 
                    From then on, I don't know if you already noticed it but I was really crushing on you 24/7
                    I will never regret going to school at 5:30 or so just to spend time with you at school ðŸ˜Œ. 
                    us buying choco-bun/choco-roll from that bakery will always hold a special place in my memory 
                    time really flies fast doesn't it? It's already almost a year of us not seeing each other 
                    well, maybe I'm just overreacting like I always do, but I really miss those times where I 
                    still wait for you to grab a tricycle before going home(Even though u always tell me to go home already ðŸ˜¤)  
                    I really wish I could live at least one of those days again, but I guess I just have to relive those in my memories for now...

                    <br />
                    I also want to thank you for your continuous effort! I really appreciate those little gestures that I 
                    (uhmm maybe demanded?ddjahsdiowd) like updating and such! I don't know, but it really adds to the assurance 
                    and makes me feel really happyyy!!! I can tell that my face brightens whenever you do those simple gestures HAHAHAHA
                    I hope that we'll always grow together and hopefully in the future, I'd be greeting you a happy valentines day 
                    not just through websites like I'm doing now... I'm really looking forward to graduating and the life that awaits me 
                    after one of the biggest days of our life which is the graduation itself! I'll keep supporting you with your dreams 
                    and will forever stay by your side as long as you want me to... I really wish to spend my life with you, Juliana.

                    <br />
                    I hope that you'll appreciate the simple gift that I'm about to give you! uhmm, you know, I've really thought about it 
                    as to why this is the gift that I came up with. well first of all, I would'nt be able to hand you a physical gift like 
                    miti or mash, and maybe because the little me always dreamt of having skins and it heals my inner child. I could've just 
                    claimed the skin myself, but I know that I'll be more satisfied if you were to get that skin! I don't know why, but it maybe 
                    just shows how much you mean to me. Giving you what my inner child would die to have will definitely fulfill my inner child and heart. 
                    I really wish you'd be happy to accept the gift and uhmm Happy Valentines po ulit Julianaaa!!! (Check your ML inbox!!!)
